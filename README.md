## Installing software

All software installed on the system must be listed in `.Brewfile`. This is
symlinked at `~/.Brewfile` and used by `brew bundle`.

To install all the software, add it to `.Brewfile` and run:

    brew bundle --global

To remove software not declared in Brewfile:

    brew bundle cleanup --global

Some things that require manual installation after Homebrew:

    # if pip requires sudo, something is wrong, b/c homebrew bundle should
    # install a $USER-writable over system-python
    pip install virtualenv
    pip install virtualenvwrapper
