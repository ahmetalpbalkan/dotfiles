A quick outline of what must be done to get everything working.

1) Install the dependencies.

    brew install gpg gpg-agent pinentry-mac Caskroom/cask/keybase 

2) Generate keys:

keybase pgp gen --multi

3) Run gpg --list-secret-keys and copy the "sec   4096R/XXXXXXXX"
   section. That's the signing public key ID to be used below.

4) Configure git to automatically gpgsign commits. This consists of
   pointing git to your signing key ID, and then enabling commit
   automatic signing.

    git config --global user.signingkey <PUB-ID>
    git config --global commit.gpgsign true

5) Copy the publickey into your clipboard:

    keybase pgp export -q <PUB-ID> | pbcopy

5) Open https://github.com/settings/keys and paste the public key
   there. 

Don't forget to upload your public key to Github!

Note: There needs to be a three-way match on your email for Github to show
the commit as 'verified': The commit email, github email, & the email associated with the public key
